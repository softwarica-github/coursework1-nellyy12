This Python script defines a network enumeration tool using various modules and classes. Here's a brief overview:

- **PortScanner Class:**
  - Initializes with a target IP, start port, and end port.
  - Provides a method `scan_ports` to scan for open ports within the specified range.

- **ServiceDetector Class:**
  - Initializes with a target IP and a list of open ports.
  - Provides a method `detect_services` to identify services running on the open ports.

- **BannerGrabber Class:**
  - Initializes with a target IP and a target port.
  - Provides a method `grab_banner` to retrieve banners from a specified port.

- **WhoisLookup Class:**
  - Initializes with a target IP.
  - Provides a method `lookup_whois_info` to perform a WHOIS lookup on the target IP.

- **DNSResolver Class:**
  - Initializes with a target URL.
  - Provides a method `resolve_dns` to resolve the IP address of the target URL.

- **ServiceAvailabilityChecker Class:**
  - Initializes with a target IP and a list of services.
  - Provides a method `check_service_availability` to check the availability of specified services.

- **IPReachabilityChecker Class:**
  - Initializes with a target IP.
  - Provides a method `check_reachability` to check if the target IP is reachable.

- **DNSEnumerator Class:**
  - Initializes with a target URL.
  - Provides a method `enumerate_dns` to perform DNS enumeration, retrieving information like subdomains, domain name, and mail servers.

- **IPLocationInfo Class:**
  - Initializes with a target IP.
  - Provides a method `get_location_info` to fetch location information using an IP geolocation API.

- **SSLInfoRetriever Class:**
  - Initializes with a target IP and a target port.
  - Provides a method `retrieve_ssl_info` to fetch SSL/TLS information, including certificate details.

- **NetworkScannerGUI Class:**
  - Implements a GUI for the network enumeration tool using Tkinter.
  - Allows users to input an IP address or URL, starting and ending ports, and initiates network scanning.
  - Displays results in a scrolled text widget.

- **Main Block:**
  - Creates an instance of `NetworkScannerGUI` and runs the Tkinter main loop.

The tool scans for open ports, detects services, grabs banners, performs WHOIS lookup, DNS resolution, service availability check, IP reachability check, IP geolocation, DNS enumeration, and SSL/TLS information retrieval. The results are displayed in the GUI and saved to a "result.txt" file.
